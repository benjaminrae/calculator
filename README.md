## About the project

---

This project was built as part of the precourse for the ISDI Coders Bootcamp. I tried to create a design similar to that of the iOS calculator app.

The calculator has full keyboard support.
| Button | Key |
| --- | --- |
| AC | <kbd>esc</kbd> |
|±|<kbd>\_</kbd>|
|%|<kbd>%</kbd>|
|0-9|<kbd>0</kbd> - <kbd>9</kbd>|
|÷|<kbd>/</kbd>|
|×|<kbd>\*</kbd>|
|-|<kbd>-</kbd>|
|+|<kbd>-</kbd>|
|=|<kbd>Enter</kbd>|
|⌫|<kbd>backspace</kbd>|
|.|<kbd>.</kbd>|

### Built with

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript

### What I learned

This project gave me the chance to put together HTML, CSS and JS for the first time. I encountered some problems along the way in order to make the calculator work as close to a real calculator as possible. For example, being able to perfom "5 + 5 + 5 + 5" without pressing equals every time.

### Possible next steps

I think this project could be taken further by

-   experimenting with color and possibly adding the ability to change colors
-   showing numbers for the current operation on the screen
-   changing the design so that the buttons aren't part of a table (CSS Grid or FlexBox)
-   allow the AC (all clear) button to change to C (clear)
